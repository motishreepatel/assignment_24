    "- Lambda function can improve code readability by making the function definition more localized and avoiding the need to define a separate named function elsewhere.\n",
    "- Lambda expressions provide a compact and concise syntax for defining small, anonymous functions in a single line of code.\n",
    "- Lambda expressions are often used in conjunction with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(). \n",
